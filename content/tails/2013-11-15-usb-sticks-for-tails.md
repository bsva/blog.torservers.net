Title:  USB Sticks for Tails

Ideally, you use TAILS from a read-only medium. CD is best, but many
devices these days don't have an optical drive, and handling CDs is not
as convenient as a USB stick.

For quite some time, people kept recommending the [TrekStor CS USB stick
](https://geizhals.de/trekstor-cs-8gb-50324-a240853.html), one of the
few sticks available in Germany with write-protection switch. Turns out
they use a new firmware, and now don't support booting from it in
read-only mode. The company confirmed this via email.

There are roughly no alternatives, and I figured I'm not the only one
looking for USB sticks with write protection switch. Via alibaba.com, a
"wholesale Chinese ebay", I contacted various Chinese suppliers, and
ended up ordering two samples. Even there, the selection of sticks with
write protection is very limited.

I ended up paying paying 60â‚¬ for the 2 samples because of shipping and
Western Union fees.

The sticks are not very fast, but acceptable, and boot in read-only
mode. They are not as slim as I hoped for, but the supplier is friendly,
production and shipping was very fast. (less than 2 weeks altogether).

Logo printing is cheap ($0.15 per stick), so to try the quality I also
had them print a logo on the samples.

I am still undecided whether I want the final sticks to have a logo, or
simply be blank to not attract too much attention. If you have a nice
idea for a logo, let me know. I want to order 100 sticks in time for
Chaos Communication Congress 30C3. The production cost is $4 per stick
(8GB), the final price (taxes, GEMA, shipping) will likely be around $15.
