(Dresden, 13.8.2013) The non-profit organization Zwiebelfreunde e.V. is
known for the “Torservers” project, which over the past years has grown
into a global network of organizations that maintain server
infrastructure for the open anonymization network Tor. Today,
Zwiebelfreunde has taken over a very popular web gateway for Tor hidden
services, onion.to.

Tor hidden services provide anonymity for website owners, mail
providers, chat systems and other Internet services. Hidden services are
designed to be accessed using Tor Browser, which additionally provides
anonymity for users of the service. Web gateways such as onion.to
provide a convenient way to reach hidden services using a regular
browser without having to install Tor. A side effect is that the broad
world of hidden services are exposed to search engines and can thus be
indexed and found. The trade-off is that users lose anonymity: Both the
gateway and the hidden service can track users across visits, and
determine the user's IP address. That is why Zwiebelfreunde strongly
encourages people to download Tor Browser instead.

“By exposing hidden services to the public, we hope to attract even more
users and widen the spectrum of available services within the Tor
network.”, says Zwiebelfreunde founder and president Moritz. “I
can imagine privacy-friendly email services to be based fully on hidden
services in the future, for example.”

The current gateway server is located in Iceland, and another one will
be added in the near future.

## Zwiebelfreunde e.V.

The German non-profit association Zwiebelfreunde e.V. serves as a
platform for projects in the area of safe and anonymous communication.
The organization facilitates and participates in educational events
about technological advances in the area of privacy, and connects
professionals to spread knowledge and experience on these fields.

“Zwiebelfreunde” is German for “Friends of the Onion”, as a reference to
Onion Routing, the name of the concept behind Tor for anonymizing
communication: Messages are passed through relays that each removes one
layer of encryption, like peeling the skin of an onion.
