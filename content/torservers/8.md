A special thanks to Richard from Network Presence in Australia for providing a full 10MBit/s Tor exit! If need Australian hosting, check out his offers at <http://networkpresence.com.au/>

I will be in Berlin for 27c3 from December 26th to 30th. Give me a call or contact me on XMPP for a meetup! My contact details are on the website.

About our planned migration to 100TB's UK data center: I haven't heard back from them yet. The only offer I got was for a Octo Core with 12TB RAM for $250, but I would rather want to go with something cheaper. The current Quad Core with 8GB RAM is ideally suited for 100 TB of Tor traffic.

Enjoy your holidays!
