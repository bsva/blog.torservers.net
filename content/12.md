Hi,

TODAY IS WORLD DAY AGAINST CENSORSHIP: http://march12.rsf.org/

It's been a while since the last update. Sorry, but I like being busy on
actually doing stuff instead of writing reports. ;-) It would be nice to
have someone go through our mailing list archive and Twitter feed, pick
all important events and put them into a timeline on our Wiki (and post
it once a month to this list?).

This is a request for comments/action (and mostly copied from our
Twitter feed). If you want to help, pick something from our TODO, talk
to us on IRC, do something you feel is appropriate. :)

- Meet local Tor fans. Organize workshops etc.
