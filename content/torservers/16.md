Hi everyone!

Zwiebelfreunde e.V. has finally received the necessary paperwork from
the tax authorities and can now open a bank account etc. Juris is
preparing a membership application form, so you should soon all be able
to join.
We're still working on The Infrastructure (TM) to replace the current
3rd party mailserver and mailing list. It's going slow, because we want
it to be useful as archetype for our franchising and decentralization
ventures.
